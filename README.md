## A social network for music education through ear training. Features are still in progress.
## This project uses:
 - Genius API

 - Node.js
 - Express
 - Diff.js (review process)
 - Auth0 to login
 - tonaljs for chord information

## WIP FEATURES 
- Spotify Api - users can control spotify through the app, useful while transcribing without changing window.
- Users can save their transcription to the server and determine viewability.
- If transcription is TOP voted for the song, it will be used as the model in a game feature. (users will be able to check their chords vs the model)
- port to Typescript
